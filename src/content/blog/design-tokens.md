# Building Scalable Design Systems with Design Tokens

Design tokens are the foundation of modern design systems. They provide a single source of truth for design decisions, making it easier to maintain consistency across products and platforms.

## What are Design Tokens?

Design tokens are name-value pairs that represent design decisions. They can represent colors, typography, spacing, shadows, and more. By centralizing these values, we ensure consistency and make it easier to update designs at scale.

## Benefits of Design Tokens

1. **Consistency**: Single source of truth for design values
2. **Maintainability**: Update once, apply everywhere
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new platforms and themes
4. **Developer Experience**: Clear naming conventions and type safety

## Implementation

When implementing design tokens, consider:

- **Naming conventions**: Use semantic names (e.g., `color.primary` instead of `color.blue`)
- **Type safety**: Use TypeScript to ensure tokens are used correctly
- **Documentation**: Keep tokens well-documented for your team
- **Tooling**: Use tools like Style Dictionary or Theo to generate tokens for different platforms

## Best Practices

- Start with a small set of tokens and expand as needed
- Use semantic naming that reflects purpose, not appearance
- Document token usage and guidelines
- Regularly audit and remove unused tokens

Design tokens are a powerful tool for building scalable design systems. By investing in them early, you'll save time and ensure consistency as your product grows.
